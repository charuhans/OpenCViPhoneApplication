Using OpenCV with XCode ProjectStep 1:  Create a new XCode project.  I have created a view based application.Step 2:  Open up the finder window and navigate to project folder and create a new folder called external. Copy OpenCV_iPhoneOS and OpenCV_iPhone Simulator folder in external. Step 3:  Now we need to tell XCode, where to find this. Select the project Navigator in the left hand panel and click on project name.  Under the TARGETS click on Build Settings.In the search bar on the top right find “Header Search Path”.  Specify the place where OpenCV headers are located. Step 4:  Similarly search for “Library Search Path” in search bar. Specify the place where OpenCV libraries are located (This path will be different for iOS and Simulator).  Step 5:  Now type “Other linker Flags” in search bar. Pass the flags to linker. We are basically telling it to include .a filesYou can put in the following value depending on your project requirement.-lopencv_calib3d -lopencv_contrib -lopencv_core -lopencv_features2d -lopencv_flann -lopencv_imgproc -lopencv_lapack -lopencv_legacy -lopencv_ml -lopencv_objdetect -lopencv_video -lzlib -lstdc++Now your project should build like a charm.
